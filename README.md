CAD files (Fusion360, STL, DXF, Prusa project, Lightburn project) for some oversize drawing instruments, useful for marking out fabric structures

A large divider-style compass, lasercut from 6mm ply. Pen and point (a cheap center punch) are held on with hair elastics.

An even larger beam compass, 3d-printed parts that fit (UK) plastic waste pipe. This makes use of the handy fact that 36mm ABS pipe is a perfect sliding fit into 41mm polypropylene pipe. Uses square M6 nuts and M6 thumbscrews. Use a 2m length of each and you get a 4m radius compass that packs down to 2m.

A giant protractor, lasercut from acrylic and paint-filled.

A giant 30/60 setsquare with metric graduations and dotted lines parallel to the edges, lasercut from acrylic and paint-filled.

The protractor and setsquare graduations are generated in Python as a Fusion360 macro.
